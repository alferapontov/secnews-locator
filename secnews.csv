EHOA takes this incident very seriously and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. What Happened? On March 23, 2020, EHOA became aware of unusual activity related to an employee email account. EHOA immediately took steps to prevent potential unauthorized access by changing passwords and beginning an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists. Through this investigation, EHOA determined that a single employee email account was accessed without authorization between February 25, 2020 and March 25, 2020. While the investigation did not determine that specific information within the account was actually viewed by an unauthorized party, EHOA engaged in a comprehensive review of the email account to identify any personal and health information that could have been accessible in the account during this time. Through this process, EHOA determined that personal and health information was present in the email account at the time of the incident. To date, EHOA is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information as a result of this incident. What Information Was Involved? The investigation determined that at the time of the incident the email account contained patient data, the majority of which was limited to first and last names contained on an internal report for purposes of reporting to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service (CMS). Certain individuals may have had other additional health information contained in the email account including, date of birth, financial information, health insurance information, Social Security number, medical information, and treatment information.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said that the group responsible for these kinds of reviews, made up of national security officials from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice, largely failed to rein in Chinese telecommunications companies because of an “informal” process, insufficient resourcing, and a lack of statutory authority. Federal Communications Commission commissioners have likened the group’s review to an “inextricable black hole,” the report said. As a result of minimal oversight from the group, known as “Team Telecom,” Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies have been able to operate with relative impunity, even as concerns have mounted that Chinese state-owned companies could be enabling espionage backed by the Chinese government within the […]

But another statement from Honda to the BBC said the incident has “also [had] an impact on production systems outside of Japan.” Cybersecurity researchers said that malicious software samples associated with the incident suggested a ransomware attack had occurred. Vitali Kremez, a strategic adviser to cybersecurity company SentinelOne, said he suspected a strain of ransomware known as Snake or EKANS was the cause of the incident.

In a lawsuit filed Monday in a Virginia court, the company sued 12 websites registered by Compsys Domain Solutions Private Ltd., an Indian proxy service. With names like InstagramHijack.com, Videocall-WhatsApp.com and Facebook-Verify-Inc.com, the sites were meant to deceive users and boost internet fraud operations, Facebook alleged. The websites either were offline or included copyright advisories at press time. Although those web URLs are clunky, they look close enough to legitimate addresses to fool people, apparently. Facebook did not specify how the Compsys-registered sites were being used prior to its suit Monday. Phishing operations are one possible use.

Now, the research arm — the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) — is turning the hardware over to elite white-hat hackers who can earn up to $25,000 for bugs they find. The goal is to throw an array of attacks at the hardware so its foundations are more secure before production. “We need the researchers to really roll their sleeves up and dig into what we’re doing and try to break it,” said Keith Rebello, a DARPA program manager. Hardware hacks often involve identifying vulnerabilities in how a computer chip handles information, like the flaw uncovered in Intel microprocessors in March that could have allowed attackers to run malicious code early in the boot process. While software bug bounties are ubiquitous in […]

The advisory from DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) comes after a spate of attacks on cell towers in Europe, and as agency officials reckon with other COVID-19-related threats, ranging from data theft to fraud. “While the U.S. has not seen similar levels of attacks against 5G infrastructure linked to the pandemic, the tactics used in Western Europe [have] begun to migrate to the U.S,” says the memo, obtained by CyberScoop. Conspiracy theorists erroneously claim that 5G networking equipment weakens the immune system, or spreads coronavirus. The anti-5G fervor has perhaps been at its most destructive in the United Kingdom, where people have damaged more than 70 cell towers since the coronavirus outbreak.

The same day, unidentified hackers began an intensive phishing campaign to infiltrate at least one of those nine firms, according to research published Monday by IBM. The findings show how multiple aspects of societies’ response to the coronavirus — from testing facilities to vaccine research to PPE procurement — have been targeted by hackers of various stripes. The phishing attempts against the unnamed German company, which are ongoing, have extended to more than 100 senior management and procurement executives at the company and its suppliers in multiple sectors, according to IBM.

The 3M corporation has filed suit against a third-party Amazon seller called KMJ Trading Inc, which allegedly sold more than $350,000 worth of N95 respirator masks, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The products were listed for as much as $23 per mask — a huge markup from the list price of $1.27.
Amazon has struggled with counterfeit mask sales since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, when N95 masks became an urgent necessity for essential workers. Amazon warned Marketplace sellers against price gouging as early as February, ultimately restricting sales of both face masks and hand sanitizer on March 11th. KMJ’s alleged price-gouging took place before those restrictions went into effect, beginning on February...

Image: Bungie
Game developer Bungie detailed the future roadmap of its sprawling online shooter Destiny 2 on Tuesday in a Twitch live stream packed with news about where the game is going this fall and how the studio plans to support it once Microsoft’s and Sony’s new consoles arrive. Perhaps the biggest news was the announcement of not just one, but three new major expansions keeping the game active until at least 2022. 
Typically, Bungie’s Destiny series, which first launched back in 2014 as the first new property from the creator of Halo, has followed a somewhat consistent release cadence. It has involved smaller updates that are peppered in once every few months, all leading up to a major fall expansion. For Destiny 1, the cycle lasted four years....

Destiny 2 is coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, and today Bungie has given additional details on just what that transition will look like when the ports release this holiday season.
First off, Bungie is promising the next-gen versions of Destiny 2 will support 60fps and 4K resolution on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, marking a significant jump from the 30fps / 1080p version of the game on current-generation consoles. 
Despite those improvements, Bungie is promising that the cross-generation versions will still be fully compatible with each other: PlayStation 5 owners will be able to play Destiny 2 with friends on the PS4 version, and Xbox Series X customers will have cross-play with the Xbox One version.

Faze Clan is taking a page out of Marvel’s playbook. Today, the organization announced that it will release a feature-length film later this year, starring Faze talent, which will kick off what it describes as “an immersive cinematic universe.”
The “Faze Clan Universe,” as it’s called, is being created in partnership with Invisible Narratives, a digital studio helmed by former Paramount president Adam Goodman and film executive Andrew Sugerman. (The studio previously partnered with Michael Bay on a movie about the pandemic.) Currently, there are no details about the movie itself — such as a title or a plot — but Faze says that it will be entirely self-financed and will feature a soundtrack from Epic Records.

Nintendo said 300,000 Nintendo Network ID (NNID) accounts were broken into as part of a hacking attempt in April, which is nearly twice as many as initially stated. Nintendo previously said that 160,000 accounts were broken into.
NNIDs were used for the 3DS and Wii U and allowed users of either system to download content and link their systems to a shared wallet. A new account system was used for the Nintendo Switch, but 3DS and Wii U owners could link their accounts.
Nintendo eliminated the option to log in via NNID
Hackers could have spent money at the My Nintendo store or the Nintendo eShop using virtual funds or money from a linked PayPal account. Additional information such as a user’s nickname, date of birth, and email address may...

It’s been nearly 30 years since the last movie in the series, but Bill and Ted Face the Music — the third film in the wacky, time-traveling comedy series — is finally concluding the franchise, and a new trailer gives us a first look at what to expect. 
Face the Music finds Alex Winters and Keanu Reeves returning as Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted “Theodore” Logan, the stoner buddies whose band — Wyld Stallyns — was supposed to write a song so good it literally saves the world. 


But decades on, the duo has yet to actually write the song, much to the disappointment of the rocking utopian future that was counting on them. So the duo concocts the idea to time-travel to the future and simply steal the song from their future...

The problems with Google’s Pixel Buds gained widespread attention last month, with users reporting audio cutouts when using the true wireless earbuds. For some, the issues only cropped up if they cupped their hand over their ear, while others experienced issues even when using the earbuds normally. The problems appear to be present across different firmware versions and while using the earbuds with a...

331,Samsung’s new Galaxy A51 is a great deal at $289,2020-06-09T11:34:54-04:00,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/6/9/21285108/samsung-galaxy-a51-unlocked-phone-deal-logitech-g502-lightspeed-segway-electric-scooter-sale,"
Samsung’s midrange Galaxy A51 is $110 off at Amazon, bringing the price down to just $289. For context, this phone released just a few months ago, and it’s worth checking out if you want an affordable phone with a big OLED screen, good build quality, a headphone jack, and compatibility with all US carriers. 
Despite it looking like a chip off the block of Samsung’s high-end Android phones that cost hundreds more, the Galaxy A51 overall performance is lacking by comparison. Its camera and battery life weren’t so great during Dieter Bohn’s review, which you can read here or watch above. Those flaws are a little easier to overlook given the price drop, but they’re worth knowing about before you invest.
